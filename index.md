**COBIND** pipeline aims to identify the co-binders/co-factors of
transcription factors (TFs). The method uses coordinates of
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) as an input and returns
information about co-binders and their binding fashion — spacings
between the two binding sites.

This repository and its contents were used to produce the results for
the COBIND manuscript. We made available COBIND as a tool, which can be
found [here](https://bitbucket.org/CBGR/cobind_tool/src/master/).

## What to expect from this page?

This page contains results from COBIND 2022 analysis. We analysed 8,792
datasets of high-confidence TFBSs stored in [UniBind
2021](https://unibind.uio.no/) database for 404 unique TFs that
collectively are from 7 species: *Arabidopsis thaliana*, *Caenorhabditis
elegans*, *Danio rerio*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, *Homo sapiens*, *Mus
musculus* and *Rattus norvegicus*.

Reports about discovered co-binders are provided for each TF (where at
least one co-binder was discovered) in different species. Another group
of reports report the discovered co-binders summarized over TF families.
